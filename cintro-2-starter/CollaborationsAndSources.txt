Everything ran well except for the array.c file I had. I was going to go to the computer lab but I was sick and I just don't have time to finish it. I'm done now though. I got no outsource help on this assignment. The lesson we had today in calss (10/3/22) helped alot with this assignmetn. I'm just having trouble with the pointer for the last question. I tried making it a global variable (that didn't work), I honestly got no clue what to do.
