I think I should sign up for a partner. I was working on this assignment for awhile all by myself and I'm just tired at this point. I didn't get any outside help this time unlike last time when the lab assistants. Honestly typing this up I think I just figured out what I needed to do but I'm done. I really tried my hardest, but I will most definilty revise this. I looked up the documentaiton you suggested in the homework. Also this homework was easy except for those small couple parts.
