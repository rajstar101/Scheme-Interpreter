I didn't collaborate with anyone on this assignment. I did this bymyself with a wipe board app I have on my windows Surface Pro 8.
I didn't use any outside resources besides the book, but I didn't really use the book. I just put alot of time into this assignment and messed around alot.
Also for the future, should I leave the guile and other file in here as well?
