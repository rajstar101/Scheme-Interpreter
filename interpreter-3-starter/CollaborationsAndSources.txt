I got a lot of help from Anna and Chisom and even though they don't need to mentioned in colaboratinos txt I thought it would be good to high light that. I also got alot of help from Daniel, Dylan, and Chris (they are all lab assistants). But other than that, there were something I struggled on, for example: I for got you need to add end terminals to teh end of a string. Also, I missed the basic Idea of many texts. But other than that, everything was fine!
